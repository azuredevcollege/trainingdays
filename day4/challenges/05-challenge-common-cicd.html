We want to introduce a professional CI/CD workflow to continuously and constantly
deploy changes and features to multiple environments. A best practice is to
first deploy changes in a separate environment before those changes eventually
go live. We can look for potential errors and ensure the quality of our
application. Such an environment is usually referred to as the <em>testing</em> stage.
But that is not enough, because it also makes sense to continuously provide the
current development status in an environment during the development period. This
gives us the opportunity to request feedback from the product owners within a
sprint. Such an environment is called the <em>development</em> stage.</p> <p>In this challenge we want to start preparing for deployment in two environments.
After changes were pushed to the master branch we deploy these changes to the
development environment. A deployment to the testing environment is only
triggered, after a manual approval. In addition, we want to check within a pull
request whether all application components can also be built. These are the
status checks of a pull request that we addressed in the last challenge.</p> <p>The following graphic illustrates the workflow:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/ci-cd-flow.919a7dc6.png" alt="CI/CD Workflow"></p> <p>The sample application is composed of various micro-services. Each service
belongs to a bounded context of the SCM domain. A bounded context defines its
own domain model and it comprises the business logic for a specific technical
area of the application. The SCM sample application consist of the following
bounded contexts:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/ddd-bounded-contexts.93c54f0e.png" alt="Domain Driven Design bounded contexts"></p> <p>Each context provides an API which the frontend accesses and presents the domain
to the user:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/frontend-apis.595f8d12.png" alt="Frontend accesses APIs"></p> <p>A bounded context should be the responsibility of a single team. However, a team
can also be responsible for several bounded contexts, but it is not recommended
that several teams work on one bounded context.</p> <p>What does this mean for our CI/CD workflow?</p> <p>Regardless of the teams, we should be able to roll out each bounded context
independently. This way we reduce the time for deployment, as the complete
application does not have to be deployed. We can implement independent release
cycles and roll out targeted features and fixes. However, this approach also
supports the development of an application by several teams.</p> <p>Later in the day we will create the following CI/CD workflows to deploy to a
development and testing environment:</p> <ul><li>scm-contactsapi</li> <li>scm-resourcesapi</li> <li>scm-searchapi</li> <li>scm-visitreportapi</li> <li>scm-frontend</li></ul> <p>In the SCM sample application's architecture no service within a bounded context
communicates directly with services from another bounded context. Instead
changes to a domain object within a bounded context are published through
events, which describe the changes. Technically, a message bus is used to
notify other bounded contexts about the changes. With this approach we can
decouple the bounded contexts. Decoupling increases the availability of our
application, because when a request is made to the API, not all services have to
be addressed. A bounded context is informed of changes via the message bus.
These changes can then be processed asynchronously and the own domain model can
be updated. This approach is also used within a bounded context. The Resource
Context for example, stores uploaded images in an Azure blob first and uses a
message queue to notify the image resizer that a new image is available. The
image resizer loads the image asynchronously in the background and creates a
thumbnail of the image.</p> <h2 id="goal"><a href="#goal" class="header-anchor">#</a> Goal</h2> <p>The goal of this challenge is to create a CI/CD workflow for shared Azure
resources. Before we can deploy all other services we need to create a set of
Azure resources, which are used by all services. We will create the necessary
GitHub Actions workflow. Don't worry, the workflow is already created, but we
need to take a few steps to activate it. This will also give us the opportunity
to introduce GitHub environments and understand how a pull request workflow
works, including status checks and reviewers. At the end of this challenge we
will have created one Azure resource group for each environment (Dev, Test).
Each resource group contains the shared components:</p> <ul><li><strong>Azure ApplicationInsights</strong>, to get a continuous monitoring of the
application</li> <li><strong>Azure ServiceBus</strong>, used to transport events from one bounded context to
another and for events within a bounded context</li> <li><strong>AppServicePlan Windows</strong>, for Windows based workloads</li> <li><strong>AppServicePlan Linux</strong>, for Linux based workloads</li> <li><strong>Consumption based AppServicePlan Windows</strong>, for Windows based Azure
Functions</li> <li><strong>Storage Account</strong>, needed for Azure Functions</li> <li><strong>Cosmos DB Account</strong>, account for Cosmos DB</li></ul> <h2 id="plan-your-work"><a href="#plan-your-work" class="header-anchor">#</a> Plan your work</h2> <p>First we want to reflect our work for this challenge on the project board. We
have already created a <em>note</em> on our project board, which says:</p> <blockquote><p>Deploy the sample application</p></blockquote> <p>To describe the outstanding work for this challenge, we create the following
issue in the imported trainingdays repository, set the label <code>azdc-challenge</code>
and link it to the <em>note</em>:</p> <div class="language-Text extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Deploy SCM shared Azure resources

</code></pre></div><div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>📝 We have already seen how to link an issue to a note in
<a href="/trainingdays/day4/challenges/01-challenge-boards.html#working-with-cards">challenge-boards</a></p></div> <p>Now drag and drop the note to the <em>In progess</em> column.</p> <p>Your board should now look like this:</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-board-overview-05.52d6ff08.png" alt="GitHub board overview 05"></p> <h2 id="create-dev-and-test-environments"><a href="#create-dev-and-test-environments" class="header-anchor">#</a> Create Dev and Test environments</h2> <p>Now it's time to prepare GitHub environments to deploy the sample application to
a <em>Dev</em> and <em>Test</em> stage. A GitHub environment can be configured with
protection rules and secrets. A workflow job can reference environments to use
environment's protection rules and secrets.</p> <h3 id="dev-environment"><a href="#dev-environment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dev environment</h3> <p>Let us first create the environment for the Development stage.</p> <p>Navigate to the imported <em>trainigdays</em> repository in your organization and go to
the repository's settings. Open the <em>Environments</em> view and create the
environment <code>day4-scm-dev</code>. As we only want to deploy the master branch to that
environment, we limit what branches can deploy to that environment.</p> <p>Select the <code>Deployment branches</code> dropdown and choose the <code>Selected branches</code>
option. Add the <code>master</code> branch as allowed branch.</p> <p>We need to add a secret, because we will create an Azure SQL Database and need
to provide an initial password, which we can securely store as an environment
secret and access it later in the GitHub Actions workflow.</p> <p>Use the <code>Add Secret</code> button to add a new secret named <code>SQL_PASSWORD</code>.</p> <p>You can generate a strong password by using the following command:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code>pwgen <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-y</span>

Service principal in our Azure Active Directory. We have already learned in
<a href="/trainingdays/day4/challenges/03-challenge-bicep.html#programmatic-access-to-azure">challenge 3</a> how we can
programmatically access an Azure subscription.</p> <p>If you don't remember your Service Principal's credentials, just create a new
one and copy the credentials from the output of the following command:</p> <div class="language-shell extra-class"><pre class="language-shell"><code><span class="token comment"># Change the name and use your subscription-id to create a Service Principal.</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now we need to store the Service Principal's credentials. Navigate to the
<em>trainingdays</em> repository <code>Settings &gt; Secrets</code>page and add a new repository
secret named <code>AZURE_CREDENTIALS</code>.</p> <h2 id="activate-the-ci-cd-workflow"><a href="#activate-the-ci-cd-workflow" class="header-anchor">#</a> Activate the CI/CD workflow</h2> <p>Now we have everything prepared to active the CI/CD workflow. First, clone the

infrastructure for all components</li></ul> <h3 id="infrastructure-as-code"><a href="#infrastructure-as-code" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infrastructure as code</h3> <p>Take your time and have a look at the structure of the bicep files. Under the
directory <code>infrastructure</code> we can find all bounded contexts of the sample
application:</p> <ul><li><strong>common</strong> &gt; the shared Azure resource</li> <li><strong>contacts</strong> &gt; Contact Context</li> <li><strong>resources</strong> &gt; Resource Context</li> <li><strong>search</strong> &gt; Search Context</li> <li><strong>visitreports</strong> &gt; VisitREport Context</li> <li><strong>frontend</strong> &gt; Frontend</li></ul> <p>Each bounded context describes its own infrastructure using code. Azure Bicep
modules are used to make the Bicep code more maintainable.</p> <p>In this challenge we will deploy the shared Azure resources used by all bounded
contexts. You can find the needed Bicep code in the workspace folder
<code>infrastructure/common</code>. There is one main Bicep module <code>commonmain.bicep</code> which
references other Bicep modules to describe the infrastructure.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/common-bicep-module.033ef7b1.png" alt="Common Bicep modules"></p> <p>After the shared Azure resources are deployed, each bounded context references

we focus on all workflows with the prefix <code>day4-</code>. First, we will prepare the
workflow for the shared Azure resources. Open the workflow

when a pull request is opened or changes were pushed to the master branch. In
addition, filters are applied to individual files:</p> <div class="language-yaml extra-class"><pre class="language-yaml"><code><span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> day4<span class="token punctuation">-</span>scm<span class="token punctuation">-</span>common

validated. With the <code>build</code>job we can make sure that everything can be created,
even if we only try to transpile Bicep code to Azure ARM templates.</p> <p>If everything can be created the next job <code>deploy-to-dev</code>is executed, but only
if the trigger event is of type <code>push</code>or <code>workflow_dispatch</code>. This means, that
the deployment will only be executed, if changes were pushed to the master
branch or the workflows is triggered manually. Within a pull request, only the
step <code>build</code> is executed to get immediately feedback if everything can be built
or not. If the build fails, the status check of a pull request would also fail
and the pull request cannot be merged.</p> <p>That is exactly what we want to achieve.

deployment to the test environment. This workflow can also be used to validate
all artifacts within a pull request. This helps us to avoid build breaks. Of
course, there would be many other scenarios that can be implemented with the
GitHub Actions workflow. Maybe it is a good idea to deploy directly to a
development environment within a pull request to even validate the deployment
before pushing changes to the master branch.</p> <p>We have so far only provided the shared Azure resources for the Azure Developer
College's sample application. There is still some work to be done. We'll move
straight into the breakout session where we'll deploy all the rest of the
bounded contexts.
