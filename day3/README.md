# Day 3 Data and AI

## Welcome

This day is about getting your hands dirty with data and AI in Azure. We will dig into the topics

- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL DB
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Cognitive Services

## Challenges

- [Challenge 0 (optional):  Baseline Deployment for Day 3](challenges/00-challenge-baseline.md) *(~15 min.)*
- [Challenge 1: Azure Cosmos DB](challenges/01-challenge-cosmosdb.md)
- [Challenge 2: Azure SQL DB](challenges/02-challenge-sql.md)
- [Challenge 3: Azure Cognitive Search](challenges/03-challenge-search.md)
- 💎 *[Breakout 1: Add data storage services to our sample application](challenges/04-challenge-bo-1.md)* 💎 *(~90 min.)*
- [Challenge 4: Cognitive Services](challenges/05-challenge-cognitive-services.md)
- 💎 *[Breakout 2: Add Cognitive Services](challenges/06-challenge-bo-2.md)* 💎 *(~30 min.)*

## Day 3 - Goal

Yesterday, we built a basic application that talks to services running as Azure Web Apps in the cloud. Today, we will enhance the application by introducing modern **Data Storage** services (SQL and NoSQL) and adding features of a modern user experience, like **full-text/semantic search**. We will also add further services and make sure, that they can loosely communicate with each other, so that the application itself remains easily extendable.

### Architecture

At the end of the day, we will have the following architecture up and running in Azure.

### Remarks

The challenges marked with the "💎" are the ones that focus on the sample application and represent the adoption of what you have learned in the challenges before. They results of the "💎" challenges will be reused in the upcoming days.

But *do not panic* in case you cannot finish them in time today: we got you covered tomorrow by a baseline deployment of today's results.

😎 Enjoy your day! 😎
