## Goal

In the previous challenges you have learned some basics about the OpenID Connect
and OAuth2 flows. You have seen how you can sign in users and how to acquire an
access token for an Azure AD's protected resource. In this challenge we will
integrate Azure AD into the sample application step by step. We will use GitHub
Actions workflows to deploy the sample application to Azure. Don't worry, the
needed GitHub Actions workflows are already implemented, but we need to take
some steps to activate them.

## Create Azure AD applications

In [Challenge 2](./02-challenge.md) you have already seen how to create an Azure
AD client application to sign in users and how to create an API application that
exposes OAuth2 permissions. We have to do the same for the sample application.

There is already a script available in the repository to create both
applications for you. It is located here:
[day5/apps/infrastructure/scripts/aad-integration.sh](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays/tree/master/day5/apps/infrastructure/scripts/aad-integration.sh).
You need to run it in a bash/Shell environment.

The script creates the server application first and then the client application
for the sample application. It also uses a
[oauth2-permissions.json](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays/tree/master/day5/apps/infrastructure/scripts/oauth2-permissions.json)
file where all needed OAuth2 permission are defined.

After running the script twice, we registered the following applications in
Azure AD:

![Azure AD Application Registration](./images/aad-app-registrations.png)

For each environment two applications are registered. One for the client and one
for all APIs of the sample application.

### Run the script

Open a shell and use Azure CLI to connect to the Azure AD Tenant where you want
to create the applications (you can also use the Azure Cloud Shell). If you have
created a new Azure AD that is not linked to an Azure subscription, add the
additional option `--allow-no-subscription`:

```shell
az login --allow-no-subscription
```

You must run the script twice:

- once for creating the applications for the `Development` stage
- once for creating the applications for the `Testing` stage

Use the following parameters to run the script for the `Development` stage and don't forget to replace the `TENANT_DOMAIN`:

| Parameter      | Value               |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| _API-APP-NAME_ | scmapi-dev          |
| _API-APP-URI_  | <http://TENANT_DOMAIN.onmicrosoft.com/scmapi-dev> |
| _UI-APP-NAME_  | scmfe-dev           |

Use the following parameter for the `Testing` stage:

| Parameter      | Value                |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| _API-APP-NAME_ | scmapi-test          |
| _API-APP-URI_  | <http://TENANT_DOMAIN.onmicrosoft.com/scmapi-test> |
| _UI-APP-NAME_  | scmfe-test           |

Navigate to the directory
[day5/apps/infrastructure/scripts](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays/tree/master/day5/apps/infrastructure/scripts) which
contains the script and the `oauth2-permissions.json` configuration file.

Run the script twice:

- once for the `Development`
- once for the `Testing`stage.

:::tip

üìù Note down the `UI AppId` and `API AppId` from the output after each run!

:::

```shell
./aad-integration.sh <API-APP-NAME> <API-APP-URI> <UI-APP-NAME>
```

If your bash does not find jq this could help:
```shell
sudo apt-get install jq
```

The output:

```shell
...
...
UI AppId for app <UI_APP_NAME>: <please note down>
API AppId for app <API_APP_NAME>: <please note down>
```

### Validate the Applications in Azure AD

After the script has been executed twice, navigate to your Azure AD and inspect
the previously created applications. You should see four new applications.

## Create development and test environments

Now it's time to prepare GitHub environments to deploy the sample application to
a _Dev_ and _Test_ stage for Day5 with Azure AD integration. A GitHub
environment can be configured with protection rules and secrets. A workflow job
can reference environments to use environment's protection rules and secrets.

### Dev environment

Let us first create the environment for the Development stage.

Navigate to the imported _trainigdays_ repository in your organization and go to
the repository's settings. Open the _Environments_ view and create the
environment `day5-scm-dev`. As we only want to deploy the master branch to that
environment, we limit what branches can deploy to that environment.

Select the `Deployment branches` dropdown and choose the `Selected branches`
option. Add the `master` branch as allowed branch.

We need to add some secrets, which are accessed later in the GitHub Actions
workflow.

Use the `Add Secret` button to add a new secret named `SQL_PASSWORD`.

You can generate a strong password by using the following command:

```shell
pwgen -n 20 -y
```

Now, add the following secrets for the Azure AD integration:

| Secret name           | Value                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AAD_API_CLIENT_ID     | _the AppId of the Azure AD's application registration for the APIs_      |
| AAD_API_CLIENT_ID_URI | <http://scmapi-dev>                                                      |
| AAD_FE_CLIENT_ID      | _the AppId of the Azure AD's application registration for the UI client_ |
| AAD_DOMAIN            | _your Azure AD's domain name e.g. azuredevcollege.onmicrosoftonline.com_ |
| AAD_INSTANCE          | <https://login.microsoftonline.com>                                      |
| AAD_TENANT_ID         | _your Azure AD's tenant or directory id_                                 |

::: warning

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you use the values you used for the application registration script
for the development environment !

:::

At the end your secrets for the development environment looks like this:

![GitHub Dev environment config](./images/gh-env-secrets.png)

### Test environment

Create another environment for the Test stage and name it `day5-scm-test`. As we
want a manual approval, before a deployment is executed to that environment, we
set _Environment protection rules_. Activate `Required reviewers` and add a
reviewer.

Select the Deployment branches dropdown and choose the Selected branches option. Add the master branch as allowed branch.

:::tip

üìù Add yourself as a Reviewer, otherwise you will have to wait until the
selected reviewer approves the deployment request.

:::

Make sure to again configure the selected branches and the `secrets` as following:

| Secret name           | Value                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AAD_API_CLIENT_ID     | _the AppId of the Azure AD's application registration for the APIs_      |
| AAD_API_CLIENT_ID_URI | <http://scmapi-test>                                                     |
| AAD_FE_CLIENT_ID      | _the AppId of the Azure AD's application registration for the UI client_ |
| AAD_DOMAIN            | _your Azure AD's domain name e.g. azuredevcollege.onmicrosoftonline.com_ |
| AAD_INSTANCE          | <https://login.microsoftonline.com>                                      |
| AAD_TENANT_ID         | _your Azure AD's tenant or directory id_                                 |
| SQL_PASSWORD          | _your password_                                                          |

## Create a service principal and store the secret

To allow GitHub to interact with our Azure Subscription we need to create a
Service principal in our Azure Active Directory. If you have already created a
service principal and added it to your repository's secrets, you can skip this
step and continue with [Activate the CI/CD
workflow](#activate-the-cicd-workflow).

Create a new Service Principal and copy the credentials from the output of the
following command:

```shell
# Change the name and use your subscription-id to create a Service Principal.
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{name}-github-actions-sp" --sdk-auth --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
```

Now we need to store the Service Principal's credentials. Navigate to the
imported _trainingdays_ repository `Settings > Secrets`page and add a new
repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

## Activate the CI/CD workflow

Now we have everything prepared to active the CI/CD workflow. First, checkout
the master branch, pull changes and create a new branch `cicd/aad-common`

```shell
git checkout master
git pull

git branch cicd/aad-common
git checkout cicd/aad-common

# or
git checkout -b cicd/aad-common
```

There is already a Visual Studio Code workspace prepared which we can simple
open with:

```shell
cd day5
code ./day5.code-workspace
```

All known application components are already available in this workspace. In
addition, we see two more directories:

- **workflows**, here we find all prepared GitHub Actions workflow for the Azure
  Developer College
- **infrastructure**, here we find all bicep modules to deploy the needed Azure
  infrastructure for all components

### GitHub Actions workflows

Now it's time to have a look at the already prepared GitHub Actions workflows
for Day5. You can find all workflows in the workspace folder `workflows`. Today
we focus on all workflows with the prefix `day5-`. First, we will prepare the
workflow for the shared Azure resources. Open the workflow
`workflows/day5-scm-common.yml`. This workflow, like all others, is triggered
when a pull request is opened or changes were pushed to the master branch. In
addition, filters are applied to individual files:

```yaml
name: day5-scm-common

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - day5/apps/infrastructure/bicep/common/**
      - .github/workflows/day5-scm-common.yml
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - day5/apps/infrastructure/bicep/common/**
      - .github/workflows/day5-scm-common.yml

  workflow_dispatch:
```

With the trigger `workflow_dispatch`it is possible to trigger the workflow
manually.

### Prepare the workflow and create a pull request

Now it's time to prepare the workflow which rolls out the shared Azure resources
for the Azure Developer College's sample application. We have already cloned the
repository and created a new branch `cicd/aad-common`.

Open the workflow `day5-scm-common.yml` and replace the organization name in
each job condition with your organization's name:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    if: github.repository == '<your organisation name>/trainingdays'
  ...
  deploy-to-dev:
    if: (github.repository == '<your organisation name>/trainingdays') && ((github.event_name == 'push') || (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'))
  ...
  delpoy-to-test:
    if: (github.repository == '<your organisation name>/trainingdays') && ((github.event_name == 'push') || (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'))
```

Save the file, commit your changes and push the branch to the remote repository:

```Shell
git add .
git commit -m "Change org name in common workflow"
git push --set-upstream origin cicd/aad-common
```

Now, create a pull request to merge the branch `cicd/aad-common` into the
`master` branch. Set `Deploy shared Azure resources for AAD integration` as
title.

:::tip

üìù If you want, you can add a reviewer. However, since you as the Administrator
are excluded from the branch rules, you can merge the pull request without a
review approval.

:::

Wait a few seconds, until the status checks are triggered and successful.

Now merge the pull request and navigate to your repository' action page. You
should see that the `day5-scm-common` workflow is triggered after a few seconds.

After the `dev` environment is deployed, go to the Azure portal an checkout the
newly created resource group and resources. The workflow is now in the
`waiting`state, because a reviewer must approve the deployment to the `test`
environment:

Review the pending deployment, leave a comment and `Approve and deploy`.

Now the test environment will be deployed. After the deployment is finished, we
have another resource group with all shared Azure resources in the test
environment.

## Deploy the frontend and adjust the Redirect URIs

Now it's time to deploy the frontend and adjust the needed Redirect URIs for the
registered Azure AD applications. Azure AD issues tokens to known endpoints,
only. The frontend is hosted as a `Static website` in an Azure storage account.
As the storage account is created with a random name in the frontend deployment,
we don't know the frontend url at the moment. First we need to deploy the
frontend to each environment and then adjust the Redirect URIss in the Azure
AD's application registration for each environment.

### Activate the workflow

Let's pull the latest changes first:

```Shell
git checkout master
git pull
```

Next, create a new feature branch `cicd/aad-frontend`:

```Shell
git checkout -b cicd/aad-frontend
```

In VS Code, open the workflow `day5-scm-frontend.yml` and replace the
organization name in each job condition with your organization's name:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-bicep:
    if: github.repository == '<your organisation name>/trainingdays'
```

Save the file, commit your changes and push the branch to the remote repository:

```Shell
git add .
git commit -m "Change org name in frontend workflow"
git push --set-upstream origin cicd/aad-frontend
```

Now, create a pull request to merge the branch `cicd/aad-frontend` into the
`master` branch. Set `Deploy frontend for AAD integration` as title.

Wait a few seconds, until the status checks are triggered and successful.

Now merge the pull request and navigate to your repository' action page. You
should see that the `day5-scm-frontend` workflow is triggered after a few
seconds.

The workflow is now in the `waiting`state, because a reviewer must approve the
deployment to the `test` environment:

Review the pending deployment, leave a comment and `Approve and deploy`.

### Adjust the Redirect URIs in the Azure AD's application registrations

After the deployment is finished, we need to adjust the Redirect URIs in the
Azure AD applications for each environment.

Navigate to the Azure portal and go to the resource group for the development
environment. The name of the resource group starts with `rg-scm-devday5-` and
end with your GitHub organization name `rg-scm-devday5-<your organization name>`. We need to find the storage account where the frontend is hosted in a
static website. The deployment created some Azure `Tags` to group the used Azure
resources regarding their bounded context. Within the resource group you can set
filters in the `Resources` details view.

Apply the following filter:

![Azure resource group filter](./images/az-frontend-tag-filter.png)

As a result we see one storage account. Open the storage account and go to the
section `Static website`. Here you can find the primary endpoint of the frontend
in the development environment. Copy the url.

Next, navigate to `Azure Active Directory > App registrations`, select `All applications` and search for `scmfe-dev`. Open the application and go to
`Authentication`. Add the `Redirect URIs` you copied to your clipboard and save
the changes:

![Azure AD adjust Redirect URIs](./images/aad-adjust-reply-url.png)

Please repeat these steps for the application in the `test` environment to
adjust the Redirect URIs, too.

### Browse the application

Open a private browser window and navigate to the frontend of the development
environment. If everything is configured correctly, you are redirected to Azure
AD. Log in and give the app the necessary OAuth2 permissions to access your data
on your behalf:

![Scm Frontend consent](./images/aad-scmfe-consent.png)

Back in the application, you see your principal name in the right upper corner:

![Azure AD User's principla name](./images/aad-principal-name.png)

## Summary

In this challenge we have registered four applications in Azure AD. Two
applications for the frontend and two applications for the back end. Each
frontend and backend application is assigned to one environment. We have
prepared two GitHub environments and set the necessary secrets to integrate into
Azure AD. The shared Azure resources and the frontend are already deployed to
the `dev`and `test`environment. Next, we go into the breakout session and roll
out the complete application.
